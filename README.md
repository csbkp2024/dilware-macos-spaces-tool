You can also assign these commands to hotkeys for quick access. 

### Example Hotkey Configuration

To set up hotkeys, add the following lines to your Hammerspoon configuration file:

```lua
hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "alt"}, "N", function()
    hs.spaces.addSpace()
end)

hs.hotkey.bind({"cmd", "alt"}, "D", function()
    hs.spaces.removeSpace(spaceID) -- Replace spaceID with the ID of the space you want to delete
end)
```

function arrangeWindows()
    local windows = hs.window.filter.new():getWindows()
    for _, window in ipairs(windows) do
        window:moveToSpace(spaceID) -- Move each window to the new space
    end
